📱 TimeBuddy Kids – Interactive Visual Timer

TimeBuddy Kids is a simple and fun mobile app designed to help children understand time through visual progress.
Instead of numbers ticking down, kids see an animal “moving” or “eating” objects as time passes. When the animal reaches the end, the timer is finished.

This app is useful for parents who want a friendly way to limit screen time, guide routines, or teach time management.
